:warning: **Important Note** : This is primarily a personal immature library to help me make some simple HTML pages. Do not rely on this or use this for anything else than to study the code and see how I approached things.

### Features

djWeb is a small __HAXE__ framework for creating simple one page HTML5 documents with pure code. Meaning all the DOM elements are being created with javascript. 

The main ideology is to have a __page__ that consists of __sections__ which are independent from each other and have some basic automation functions like responding to when they are scrolled into view or resizing according to rules.

 - WEBM box
 - Dynamic Fixed Header
 - BG Tile Scroller
 - AutoText
 - Various DOM tools and Helpers
 - Preliminary mobile support
 - ScrollAware objects that respond to on-off scroll into view
 - Simple Loader class for preloading images and json files
