### Features

DjWeb is a small __HAXE__ framework for creating simple one page HTML5 documents with pure code. Meaning all the DOM elements are being created with javascript. 

The main ideology is to have a __page__ that consists of __sections__ which are independent from each other and have some basic automation functions like responding to when they are scrolled into view or resizing according to rules.

 - WEBM box
 - Dynamic Fixed Header
 - BG Tile Scroller
 - AutoText
 - Various DOM tools and Helpers
 - Preliminary mobile support
 - ScrollAware objects that respond to on-off scroll into view
 - Simple Loader class for preloading images and json files

To see the code in action , please check out my [showcase page](http://johndimi.bitballoon.com) and it's [source](https://github.com/johndimi/myhaxesite)


### Future

More things to come, like forms, changing fonts on the fly, infinite scrolling with dynamically addind and removing sections, multiple pages and more.

I really need to properly document this and provide examples :-/ :-O
